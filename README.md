# UWVR club workshop: animating a 3D ball with 3.js

Hello&#x1F44B; In this workshop, we'll be going over some of the basic concepts of the JavaScript API 3.js, which is used to render 3D animated graphics in your web browser.

## What is UWVR?
UWVR is a student organization at the University of Waterloo dedicated to increasing awareness about careers in the field of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, encouraging project development among students, and hosting cool events around new experiences in VR. We started in 2018 as Canada's first ever student VR community, and our current team, consisting of Falah, Brandon, Ayan, and myself, carry the same passion that grew the club to where it stands today.

## Setup
We will be using python3 `http.server` to locally test our web app. It comes installed with python so as long as you have python on your computer, you'll be fine.

Use `python -m http.server 8000` to run your web app. See the results in http://localhost:8000/.
